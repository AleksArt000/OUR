[description]
Cairo is a 2D graphics library with support for multiple output devices.
Currently supported output targets include the X Window System, Win32, image buffers, PostScript, PDF and SVG.
Experimental backends include OpenGL, Quartz and XCB file output. Cairo is designed to produce consistent output on all-
output media while taking advantage of display hardware acceleration when available (e.g. through the X Render Extension).
The Cairo API provides operations similar to the drawing operators of PostScript and PDF.
Operations in Cairo include stroking and filling cubic BÃ©zier splines, transforming and compositing translucent images, and antialiased text rendering.
All drawing operations can be transformed by any affine transformation (scale, rotation, shear, etc.)
