[description]
The lmdb package is a fast, compact, key-value embedded data store. It uses memory-mapped files, so it has the read performance of a pure in-memory database while still offering the persistence of standard disk-based databases, and is only limited to the size of the virtual address space 

[install]
wget $URL
tar -xf LMDB_0.9.29.tar.gz
cd LMDB_0.9.29
cd libraries/liblmdb &&
make                 &&
sed -i 's| liblmdb.a||' Makefile
make prefix=/usr install
